# Student Transport Riders Association questions Metro Tunnel opening plans
The Student Transport Riders Association – the voice of Victoria's student commuters – praises the opening of the Melbourne Metro Tunnel on schedule but holds reservations regarding the staged opening strategy and questions details around how it will interact with the rest of the suburban network.

The Victorian Government announced today that the Metro Tunnel would open in early December of 2025, beginning with 'The Summer Start', a period of limited operation in which the tunnel will run with 20 minute frequencies alongside existing services on the Sunbury, Cranbourne, and Pakenham lines through the City Loop.

The State Government also announced that the new tunnel would be fully operational on February 1st of 2026, in time for students commuting during first semester to utilise it.

Incorporated in 2025, the Student Transport Riders Association is a youth-run not-for-profit organisation advocating for the rights and needs of students and young people on public and active transport.

The STRA is concerned that delaying the full operation will undermine public perceptions of the project and result in reduced ridership.

"We're worried that this staged opening strategy will confuse passengers and create opportunity to delay when the Metro Tunnel becomes fully operational," said STRA President Duale Siad.

"We don't want people's first interaction with the line to discourage them from using it and put more cars on the road

"The worst case scenario would be for this project's rollout to prevent students from getting frequent and sustainable transport to and from many of the state's largest tertiary campuses from Day One next semester." 

Additionally, the STRA is calling for clarification from the State Government on the operational status of the Werribee, Williamstown, and Sandringham lines.

"We're seeing conflicting information around whether the Werribee, Williamstown, and Sandringham lines are going to be connected as planned when the Metro Tunnel opens," said Siad.

"It's essential that students at Victoria University's Footscray and Werribee campuses travelling from the Eastern suburbs are able to make the same or similar journeys as they are currently able to with the Frankston line's connection to Werribee and Williamstown."
